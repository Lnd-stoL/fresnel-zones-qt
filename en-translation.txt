	Point of observation (eye) can be moved to change the distance from the screen
	
3)  Distance from the screen / Hole radius
	Set the number of the zones in the hole
	Wavelength
	Reset
	
4)  I0 - intensity in the abscence of the screen with a hole

	Close all
	Open all
	Close even
	
5)  Intensity at the point of observation
	Amplitude at the axis
	Type of the phase plate
	half-wavelength
	stepwise
